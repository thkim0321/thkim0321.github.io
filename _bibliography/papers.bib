  abstract = {Does direct democracy enhance political efficacy? This article examines the effect of direct democracy on political efficacy. Normative theorists have suggested that direct democracy has educative effects on citizens, such as promoting political efficacy. While a number of studies have examined the corresponding hypothesis, their empirical findings are not clear-cut. This study attributes the inconsistent results to two problems of the existing studies: the employment of cross-sectional data and the heterogeneity of popular vote issues. This study closes this gap by examining the effect of direct democracy in local politics on political efficacy in a more systematic and controlled way. More concretely, it utilizes the Japanese case: In the first decade of this century, more than 400 Japanese municipalities held a popular vote for the first time because the Japanese national government promoted municipal merger. Therefore, the Japanese case provides multiple popular votes on comparable substantive topics that can be conceived as an homogeneous treatment. By applying multilevel modeling to panel survey data, this study demonstrates the causal effect that the popular vote increases the level of internal political efficacy.},

  title = {The impact of election outcome on internal political efficacy: The role of contextual factors},
  abstract = {Many studies have investigated the consequences of election outcome for one of the important public attitudes, political efficacy. The effect of election outcome on external efficacy has been confirmed by most previous studies, whereas the effect on internal efficacy is not clear-cut. By reconceptualizing internal efficacy based on the social cognitive theory of self-efficacy, this study argues that there are two conditions for an election outcome’s impact on internal efficacy: the expected difficulty of winning and the level of involvement in the election. By analyzing panel survey data collected for three Japanese Lower House elections, this study shows that election outcome exerted an impact on internal efficacy if the following two conditions were simultaneously satisfied: (1) winners/losers perceived that the election was difficult/easy to win, and (2) voters were deeply involved in the election process.},

  title = {The Impact of Politicians{\textquotesingle} Behaviors on Hate Speech Diffusion: Analysis Focusing on Adoption Threshold of Hate Speech on Twitter in Japan},
  abbr = {Under Review},
  abstract = {In this paper, we hypothesized that a leading politician's behavior signaling support for the ideas of hate groups will increase hate speech by shifting social norms. To examine the hypotheses, in particular, to quantify the social norms shift, the study utilized an adoption threshold measure based on Twitter retweet networks. Our empirical study focused on the hate speech diffusion effect of an announcement by Yuriko Koike, Governor of Tokyo, declining to participate in a memorial ceremony for Korean massacre victims. The results support the hypothesis: after Koike’s announcement, adoption thresholds of hate speech users were significantly lowered, while the number of hate speech users increased. Further, this study compared the effect of Koike’s announcement to the effect of a North Korean missile launch, a national security threat to Japan. The average hate speech adoption threshold was lower after Koike’s announcement than after the missile launch, suggesting that a leading politician’s behavior could have a greater impact on shifting norms of prejudice than even a nationally threatening event.},
